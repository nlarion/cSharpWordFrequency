## Description

###This is a project that allows the user to enter a sentence and a word to match in that sentence and it will return the number of times that word appears in said sentence. It also meets the following criteria:
* Project contains specs file and each spec has it's own method.
* Uses the Razor framework correctly to display the app.
* App passes all tests.

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing.
